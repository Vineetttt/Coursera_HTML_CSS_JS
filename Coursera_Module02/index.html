            <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, which is the most widely used language on Web to
                develop web pages. HTML was created by Berners-Lee in late 1991.HTML is the most basic building
                block of the Web.Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and
                render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically
                and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>

            <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document
                written in a markup language such as HTML.CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web.
                CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and
                fonts.The name cascading comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies
                if more than one rule matches a particular element. </p>

            <p>JavaScript often abbreviated JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of
                the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.Over 97% of websites use JavaScript on the client
                side for web page behavior,often incorporating third-party libraries.All major web browsers
                have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.JavaScript is a high-level,
                often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.</p>
